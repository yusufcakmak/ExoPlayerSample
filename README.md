# ExoPlayer2 Sample Project

I created this repository for developers who recently start learning ExoPlayer. This repository demonstrates the basic way how we can play audio/video files/URLs.

Exoplayer version : 2.16.1

### RadioPlayerActivity
This activity contains an example of how we can create basically player object and stream audio from URL.

### VideoPlayerActivity

This activity contains an example of how we can create basically player object and play video from URL with custom player controls.



Please follow the Google official guide and medium publications for more advanced topics.
